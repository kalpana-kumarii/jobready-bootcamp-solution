Classes and Objects
1. Define a class Complex to represent a complex number. Declare instance member
variables to store real and imaginary part of a complex number, also define instance
member functions to set values of complex number and print values of complex
number

number of instance member variables and also define instance member functions to
set values for time and display values of time.

of a number using class.
4. Define a class LargestNumber and define an instance member function to find the
Largest of three Numbers using the class.
5. Define a class ReverseNumber and define an instance member function to find
Reverse of a Number using class.
6. Define a class Square to find the square of a number and write a C++ program to
Count number of times a function is called.
7. Define a class Greatest and define instance member function to find Largest among
3 numbers using classes.

the rectangle.
9. Define a class Circle and define an instance member function to find the area of the
circle.
10. Define a class Area and define instance member functions to find the area of the
different shapes like square, rectangle , circle etc.
