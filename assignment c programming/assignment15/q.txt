1. Write a function to find the greatest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
2. Write a function to find the smallest number from the given array of any size. (TSRS)
3. Write a function to sort an array of any size. (TSRS)
4. Write a function to rotate an array by n position in d direction. The d is an indicative 
value for left or right. (For example, if array of size 5 is [32, 29, 40, 12, 70]; n is 2 and 
d is left, then the resulting array after left rotation 2 times is [40, 12, 70, 32, 29] )
5. Write a function to find the first occurrence of adjacent duplicate values in the array. 
Function has to return the value of the element.
6. Write a function in C to read n number of values in an array and display it in reverse 
order.
7. Write a function in C to count a total number of duplicate elements in an array.
8. Write a function in C to print all unique elements in an array.
9. Write a function in C to merge two arrays of the same size sorted in descending
