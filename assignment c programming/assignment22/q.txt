DMA
1. Define a function to input variable length string and store it in an array without
memory wastage.
2. Write a program to ask the user to input a number of data values he would like to
enter then create an array dynamically to accommodate the data values. Now take
the input from the user and display the average of data values.
3. Write a program to calculate the sum of n numbers entered by the user using malloc
and free.
4. Write a program to input and print text using dynamic memory allocation.
5. Write a program to read a one dimensional array, print sum of all elements along with
inputted array elements using dynamic memory allocation.
6. Write a program in C to find the largest element using Dynamic Memory Allocation.
7. Write a program to demonstrate memory leak in C.
8. Write a program to demonstrate dangling pointers in C.
9. Write a program to allocate memory dynamically of the size in bytes entered by the
user. Also handle the case when memory allocation is failed.
10. Find out the maximum and minimum from an array using dynamic memory allocation
in C
